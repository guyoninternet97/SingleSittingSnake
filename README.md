# SingleSittingSnake
#### Author: James Proulx
An implementation whose first commit was programmed all in one sitting!

As a personal project/challenge, I wanted to create Snake in one sitting in java, using swing.
This is what I came up with! I will be adding things to it periodically. Thanks for checking it out!
